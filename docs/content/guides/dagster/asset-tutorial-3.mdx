# Advanced: Scheduling Job Runs

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/" />

Dagster includes a scheduler that allows you to run jobs at regular intervals, e.g. daily or hourly.

## Defining schedules

As before, we've defined a pair of assets.

```python
```

Suppose that we need to rematerialize these assets every morning before breakfast, at 6:45 AM. To do this, we'll build a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to define our scheduled job. We can either directly construct a `ScheduleDefinition`, or use one of the included schedule decorators.

In this example, we'll use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="schedule" displayText="@schedule" /> decorator, which runs a schedule once a day at a specified time.

```python
asset_graph = AssetGraph([cereal, sugariest_cereal])
scheduled_job = asset_graph.build_scheduled_job("45 6 * * *")
```

To complete the picture, we'll define a repository that packages the scheduled job together with the asset graph that it runs over. A repository is a collection of Dagster definitions that can be loaded all together.

```python
@repository
def hello_cereal_repository():
    return [asset_graph, scheduled_job]
```

## Starting schedules

Now, we can load Dagit to view the schedule, start and stop it, and monitor the runs it creates:

```bash
dagit -f scheduler.py
```

The left sidebar of Dagit displays a clock icon next to each job with a schedule.

<Image
alt="schedules.png"
src="/images/tutorial/schedules.png"
width={3478}
height={2184}
/>

Clicking on the clock icon will take us to the Schedules view. From here, we can turn on the schedule by pressing the toggle button, at which point Dagit will show us that the schedule is running and will next execute tomorrow at 6:45 AM.

/>

### Running the schedule

Dagster's default scheduler requires you to launch a long-running `dagster-daemon` process in addition to Dagit.

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

This process will periodically check for any running schedules and launch their associated runs. If you leave this process running, it will launch a new run for your schedule each day at the expected time.
