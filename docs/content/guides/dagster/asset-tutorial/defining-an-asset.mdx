# A First Asset

## The Cereal Dataset

Our assets will represent and transform a simple but scary CSV dataset, cereal.csv, which contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast cereals.

## Hello, Asset!

Let's write our first Dagster asset and save it as `cereal.py`.

A software-defined specifies an asset that you want to exist and how to compute its contents. Typically, you'll define assets by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="asset" decorator /> decorator.

Our first asset represents a dataset of cereal data, downloaded from the internet.

```python
import requests
import csv
from dagster import job, op, get_dagster_logger


@asset
def cereals():
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereal_rows = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]

    get_dagster_logger().info(f"Found {len(cereal_rows)} cereal_rows")

    return cereal_rows
```

In this simple case, our asset doesn't depend on any other assets.

## Materializing our asset

"Materializing" an asset means computing its contents and then writing them to persistent storage. By default, Dagster will pickle the contents of an asset and store them on the local filesystem, using the name of the asset as the name of the file. Where and how the contents are stored is fully customizable - e.g. you might store them in a database or a cloud object store like S3 - by providing a custom "IO manager". We'll look at how that works later.

This example also makes the assumption that we'd like to separate business logic from IO. For an example of how not to do that, take a look at.

Assuming youâ€™ve saved this code as `cereal.py`, you can execute it via two different mechanisms:

### Dagit

To visualize your assets in Dagit, just run the following. Make sure you're in the directory that contains the file with your code:

```bash
dagit -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see output like

```bash
Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your web browser and view your asset.

<img
alt="hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
/>

Click on the "Materialize All" button. A new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1.

<img
alt="hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to the run that's materializing your asset.

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather materialize your asset as a script, you can do that without spinning up Dagit. Just add a few lines to `hello_cereal.py`

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = AssetCollection([cereal]).materialize_all()
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python hello_cereal.py
```
